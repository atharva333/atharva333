### Hello there 👋

I'm a **Machine Learning Research Engineer** - interested in everything 3D vision and robotics 🤖📷

- 🧑‍💻 I work on **3D computer vision** at Epic Games which I joined as part of a startup acquisition from Loci. We created a 3D-first VLM that uses different representations (such as pointclouds, multi-view images, voxels, meshes) to learn fine-grained details of 3D objects. See my [blog post on 3D encoders](https://medium.com/@loci.ai/efficient-representations-for-3d-content-understanding-7dbcaecf0f90)!
  
- 🦾 I’m also learning about [VLA](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolvla) [models](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T) for data-efficient robot learning. I've setup the [SO-ARM100](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) to use with the [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) library to perform pick and place tasks. <br> My team recently participated in the LeRobot hackathon where we won a novelty prize in the London hackathon and placed in the top 30 winners for the [global hackathon](https://huggingface.co/spaces/LeRobot-worldwide-hackathon/all-winners) for finetuning a VLA model and showing novel generalisation capabilities.
